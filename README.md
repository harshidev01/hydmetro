The Hyderabad Metro API provides real-time data on metro schedules, routes, and station locations, ensuring seamless travel planning. It allows developers to integrate live updates and connectivity information into apps and services.

### Personal Story Behind the Project

Hello everyone,

I want to share an incident from my past that inspired me to dive into solving a real problem.

It was around 10:50 PM, and I needed to travel from Kukatpally to Raidurg. I had two options for transportation: 1) Hyderabad Metro and 2) an online cab. For some reason, I chose the metro that night. But here's where the problem began: I was at the metro station, and I was too late to catch the last train. Since I was new to the metro system, I opened my mobile browser and searched for the Hyderabad Metro route, thinking it was similar to the DELHI metro system.

As a tech enthusiast, I prefer to use my phone rather than going to a ticket counter. I booked my online ticket through PhonePe and then searched for the route on [https://www.ltmetro.com/](https://www.ltmetro.com/). Unfortunately, the website only showed fares, the number of stations, and some other details, but nothing about interchange stations, which was crucial for my journey. And you can guess what happened next: I ended up in Punjagutta, which was on a completely different line, and the last train had already left. It was quite a funny and frustrating experience!

This incident inspired me to create a solution using Python, PostgreSQL, and ReactJSâ€”of course, with a little help from my brain.
